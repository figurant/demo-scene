# Auditable Multimodal Claims Triage with Vane

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A vehicle claim rarely lives in one table: claim records are stored in PostgreSQL, damage photos and supporting documents live in MinIO, and the final recommendation must remain reviewable. This demo turns those inputs into one Vane Relation pipeline that checks material quality, reuses a RapidOCR engine, extracts damage facts with a real local Qwen multimodal model, applies deterministic DuckDB SQL rules, and atomically publishes one recommendation per claim.

The synthetic fixture covers four workflow outcomes:

| Claim | Expected disposition |
| --- | --- |
| `CLM-APPROVE` | `approve_for_payment` |
| `CLM-DENY` | `deny_claim` |
| `CLM-MISSING` | `request_more_materials` |
| `CLM-REVIEW` | `manual_review` |

> These are workflow recommendations, not coverage decisions, liability findings, payment calculations, or regulated final denials.

## Why Vane

Vane is a multi-compute engine for multimodal data: it lets structured records, documents, images, SQL, stateless Python UDFs, stateful actors, and AI models work together in one composable and traceable Relation pipeline. Vane also separates pipeline logic from execution backends. The checked-in configuration defaults to the `ray` Runner, while Local and Ray share the same relation contracts. Local creates one RapidOCR engine on the driver, processes each eligible supporting-document locator once, and exposes the immutable results to SQL; Ray initializes the native ONNX engine inside an isolated stateful Actor worker. In both modes, Vane SQL loads each verified image as a BLOB and calls multimodal `ai_prompt` directly.

## Architecture

![Vane multimodal claims data flow](docs/vane-claims-data-flow.en.png)

The diagram shows the shared logical Relation boundaries; Local and Ray place OCR and AI execution differently as described below.

```text
PostgreSQL claims + MinIO photos/documents
  -> object, hash, quality, and OCR facts
  -> trusted photo requests
  -> Qwen multimodal fact extraction
  -> deterministic decision SQL
  -> contract validation
  -> atomic PostgreSQL publication
```

The core relation path is:

```text
stg_claims / stg_claim_materials / stg_run_config
  -> int_claim_material_facts
  -> int_claim_photo_ai
  -> int_claim_damage_facts
  -> int_claim_decision_facts
  -> claim_disposition
```

1. Reads four synthetic claims and their material metadata from PostgreSQL, then follows the stored MinIO locators to read vehicle-damage photos and supporting claim documents; the runtime never reads local fixture files directly.
2. Validates each material's file identity, order, role, media type, bucket, and canonical object path, then checks MinIO object existence and computes SHA-256 so that incorrect or replaced files cannot enter automated processing.
3. Calls `document_ocr_json` directly in `int_claim_document_ocr_udf.sql`, then lets downstream SQL extract claim number, claimant name, and loss date and determine whether the materials are complete, legible, and consistent with the current claim. Local runs one driver-owned RapidOCR engine and attaches an immutable result lookup; Ray attaches the reusable stateful Actor. Both paths return the same OCR JSON contract to SQL.
4. Builds one trusted SQL row per photo that passes completeness, quality, and hash validation, rechecks the object SHA-256 while loading its BLOB, and calls Qwen through SQL `ai_prompt` to extract target-vehicle clarity, visible damage, damaged parts, damage types, severity, confidence, and uncertainty reasons.
5. Enforces the model-response contract in the direct Runner projection `int_claim_damage_validation_udf.sql`, then uses pure SQL to aggregate every photo result for each claim and identify failures, conflicting evidence, unclear target vehicles, insufficient confidence, and high-severity risks.
6. Applies deterministic SQL precedence for requesting more materials, manual review, denial candidates, and payment candidates; validates the nine-column output contract; and writes the result to PostgreSQL in one transaction. The built-in fixture verifies that all four workflow outcomes remain reproducible.

## Run the demo

This demo requires CPython 3.12 and an image-capable `vane-ai==0.1.0a1` build whose DuckDB engine exposes `ai_prompt(VARCHAR, BLOB, STRUCT)`. The launcher pins the verified engine/source revision and probes that overload before starting. Follow the [complete runbook](docs/runbook.md) to prepare that Vane environment, install the demo dependencies, and start PostgreSQL, MinIO, and Qwen. Then run:

```bash
python scripts/run_demo.py e2e
```

`runtime.yml` defaults to `runner: ray`, exercising the distributed Actor and AI Relation path. Set it to `runner: local` only when intentionally testing the Local backend. Both modes use the same SQL contracts; the default Ray path still needs enough CPU, heap, and object-store capacity in the target environment.

A successful run prints:

```text
loaded 4 claims and 8 objects
published 4 claim dispositions
verified 4 claim dispositions: CLM-APPROVE=approve_for_payment, CLM-DENY=deny_claim, CLM-MISSING=request_more_materials, CLM-REVIEW=manual_review
```

There is no AI mock fallback: unavailable services, unreadable images, invalid AI JSON, incompatible runtimes, SQL failures, and publication failures all exit nonzero.

## Implementation layout and where Vane is used

The DAG includes all 20 SQL files. Solid arrows show the main execution flow; dashed arrows show additional direct dependencies that cross phases.

![Claims disposition SQL dependency DAG](docs/vane-claims-sql-dag.png)

`int_claim_photo_ai_inputs.sql` builds the trusted prompt rows, and `int_claim_photo_ai.sql` loads each hash-verified image BLOB and invokes multimodal `ai_prompt`. The raw response then remains in the existing trusted-identity, validation, aggregation, and decision SQL chain.

```

The execution path is `run_demo.py → cli.py → pipeline.py → Vane Function/Actor/SQL ai_prompt → SQL Relations → output_writer.py → verify_outputs.py`. The driver reads PostgreSQL/MinIO, owns the pure-SQL DuckDB catalog, and publishes the output. `pipeline.py` stages driver inputs as temporary Parquet, executes direct UDF and AI SQL projections through the selected Vane Runner, and registers each materialized result back in the driver catalog. Local uses a driver-owned immutable OCR lookup while Ray attaches the OCR Actor; both execute the same image-BLOB `ai_prompt` SQL and preserve the same typed contracts.

## Decision boundary

Qwen extracts damage facts, confidence, and evidence limitations; it never decides whether to pay or deny a claim. SQL applies this priority order:

1. `request_more_materials`
2. `manual_review`
3. `deny_claim`
4. `approve_for_payment`

Missing material, uncertain evidence, conflicting photos, an unclear target vehicle, or high-severity risk cannot enter the automatic payment/denial candidates.

## Adapt it to your environment

- Replace the PostgreSQL snapshot with your claims source while keeping one row per claim.
- Replace MinIO with an S3-compatible object store behind the same locator/byte contract.
- Replace RapidOCR while preserving the OCR JSON boundary.
- Point `runtime.yml` at another OpenAI-compatible multimodal model that returns the same schema.
- Change or extend the SQL rules without moving the final decision into the model.
