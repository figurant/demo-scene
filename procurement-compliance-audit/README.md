# Procurement Conflict-of-Interest and Scoring Anomaly Audit with Vane

**English** | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Before a tender, one expert recommended “Jingwei Automation.” During evaluation, he did not recuse himself and gave that supplier an unusually high score; after removing his scores, the winner changes from `SUP-JW-001` to `SUP-ZJ-002`.

This demo combines structured score data with two image artifacts, extracts recommendation/participation/recusal facts, recalculates the ranking, and produces three deterministic audit findings:

```text
Result: review_required | 3 findings | flagged expert EXP-001
Winner recalculation: SUP-JW-001 -> SUP-ZJ-002
```

> The output is an evidence-backed review signal, not a legal, disciplinary, or final compliance decision.

## Why Vane

Vane is a multi-compute engine for multimodal data: it lets score tables, document images, SQL, stateless Python UDFs, stateful actors, and AI models work together in one composable and traceable Relation pipeline. The OCR worker is registered with `@vane.cls`, the strict response validator with `@vane.func`, and Qwen is accessed through Vane's AI APIs. The checked-in configuration defaults to the `local` Runner, and the same fixture is verified on both Local and Ray. Local creates one RapidOCR engine on the driver, processes each trusted evidence locator once, and exposes the immutable results to SQL; Ray attaches the OCR worker as a stateful expression and invokes Qwen through the `vane.ai.prompt` AI Function.

## Architecture

![Vane procurement compliance audit data flow](docs/vane-procurement-audit-data-flow.en.png)

The diagram shows the shared logical Relation boundaries; Local and Ray place OCR and AI execution differently as described below.

```text
PostgreSQL project/supplier/score/evidence rows + 2 MinIO PNG objects
  -> typed score and evidence relations
  -> RapidOCR (driver-local lookup or Ray actor)
  -> Qwen multimodal fact extraction
  -> strict AI response contract
  -> SQL score metrics and three audit rules
  -> audit_findings + audit_summary
```

1. Reads project, supplier, expert-score, and evidence-file metadata from PostgreSQL, then uses the stored `bucket/object_key` locators to read the recommendation record and committee minutes as two PNG images from MinIO.
2. Validates the project, suppliers, the complete four-expert-by-three-supplier score matrix, evidence roles, and MinIO locators so that downstream processing receives complete, trusted source data.
3. Calls `evidence_ocr_json` directly in `int_evidence_ocr_udf.sql`, then parses image text, OCR status, and confidence in `int_evidence_ocr.sql`; only quality-qualified evidence reaches multimodal analysis. Local uses one driver-owned RapidOCR engine and an immutable result lookup, while Ray uses the reusable stateful Actor. Both return the same OCR JSON contract.
4. Sends the images, OCR text, and supplier context to Qwen to extract structured facts such as which supplier the expert recommended, whether the expert participated or recused, the supporting evidence text, and confidence. A strict JSON contract and the trusted evidence role validate those facts.
5. Uses deterministic SQL to compare the related expert's score with the other experts' average and rank suppliers both with and without that expert, producing three findings: an undisclosed relationship without recusal, a materially elevated score, and a changed award result after removing the expert.
6. Produces `audit_findings.jsonl` and `audit_summary.jsonl`. With sufficient evidence, the result is `review_required` with reviewable metrics, thresholds, and evidence references; insufficient evidence is explicitly reported as `insufficient_evidence` instead of allowing the model to declare a violation.

## Run the demo

This demo requires CPython 3.12 and pins the public PyPI release `vane-ai==0.1.0a1`. The release provides CPython 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12 `manylinux_2_28_x86_64` wheels (glibc 2.28 or newer), but the launcher accepts only this demo's validated CPython 3.12 runtime. Follow the [complete runbook](docs/runbook.md) to create the environment, install Vane with `python -m pip install vane-ai`, install the demo with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`, and prepare running PostgreSQL, MinIO, and local Qwen services. Then run:

```bash
python scripts/run_demo.py e2e
```

`runtime.yml` defaults to `runner: local`. Set it to `runner: ray` and connect a Ray cluster to exercise the distributed Actor and AI Relation path; both modes have been verified with the real fixture, OCR, and Qwen service.

`e2e` seeds synthetic data into PostgreSQL/MinIO, then runs a pipeline whose inputs come only from those services. It performs real OCR and Qwen inference; there is no AI mock fallback. It produces:

```text
output/audit_findings.jsonl  # 3 rows
output/audit_summary.jsonl   # 1 row
```

```

The execution path is `run_demo.py → cli.py → source_data.py → pipeline.py → Vane OCR/AI/validation → SQL Relations → verify_outputs.py → output_writer.py`. The driver reads PostgreSQL/MinIO, validates the Arrow `SourceBundle`, owns the pure-SQL DuckDB catalog, verifies the fixture result, and publishes JSONL. For the OCR and response-validation `*_udf.sql` projections, `pipeline.py` stages driver inputs as temporary Parquet, executes them through the selected Vane Runner, and registers the materialized results back in the driver catalog. Local builds the OCR lookup and AI response table with one driver-owned OCR implementation and one reused Vane provider prompter; Ray attaches the OCR Actor and executes AI through `vane.ai.prompt`. Downstream SQL keeps the same parsing, trusted-role filtering, score deviation, reranking, and audit-rule contracts.

## Audit logic and boundaries

The model extracts document type, expert, supplier, recommendation, participation, recusal, evidence text, and confidence; it does not decide whether a violation occurred. SQL produces:

1. `EXP-001-conflict-not-recused`: recommendation followed by participation without recusal.
2. `EXP-002-score-bias`: the related supplier is scored at least 15 points above peers.
3. `EXP-003-award-impact`: removing the expert changes the winner.

Both images must pass OCR and reach Qwen. Invalid response contracts fail the run; valid responses below the confidence threshold produce no findings and an `insufficient_evidence` summary.

## Adapt it to your environment

- Replace the four PostgreSQL raw tables with your procurement snapshot while preserving relation grain.
- Put your own MinIO/S3-compatible `bucket/object_key` locators in `evidence_files`.
- Replace RapidOCR while preserving the OCR JSON boundary.
- Point `runtime.yml` at another OpenAI-compatible multimodal model with the same response schema.
- Add explicit, testable SQL branches for new audit rules; keep risk conclusions out of the model.
